							We spent a lot of time working on the coding assignment this week.
							Several days were spent at the library making sure that the program
							was where we wanted it to be before our presentation. We managed to
							get all of the game rules enforced with just some minor issues. After the
							coding assignment presentation, I went into the project and changed all
							of the camera changing buttons that were on the UI to map to key presses
							instead, making gameplay flow much smoother.

							We're finally making some big strides in terms of content being
							implemented in the game. After having resolved the major issues
							with the PiecePlacer.cs script towards the end of last week, I
							finally had the framework in place to start moving forward. This
							week, I've added rule enforcement for ensuring that players can
							only place the allowable number of pieces, that they cannot place
							pieces until after rolling, added tracking of player inventory,
							and added checks for end game conditions, among other 
							adjustments. We were also able to add sprites to the
							pieces when they are placed, so they look like the actual game
							pieces instead of just grey pieces.
						</p>
						<p>
							We also met with Nathan again this week to discuss the progress
							we've made and any Unity add-ons that would potentially be useful
							for aiding in development. After the significant strides we've made
							in development this week, we informed him that we didn't think it
							would be worth investing in the only add-on we saw that we thought
							may be useful for us.

							We had another opportunity to meet with Nathan towards the beginning
							of this week. We discussed the state of the project and discussed
							some of the difficulties we've encountered. He suggested looking
							into add-ons for Unity that may help implement some of the features
							that we need to put into the game. We spent some time after the
							meeting going through some of the add-ons to try to see if there was
							anything that might help us. In particular, something for the card
							functionality would be useful, but we did not find much. There was
							one add-on that might have helped with the hex-grid for the map, but
							it also probably would have meant attempting to completely redo the map.
						</p>
						<p>
							Near the end of the week, I managed to get the PiecePlacer.cs script
							that had been giving us so much trouble to finally work at least
							mostly correctly. There are still some minor tweaks that need to be
							made, but I think this will help get things moving.

							The team met this week and went through the process of getting one

							pieces and updated the script responsible for having the pieces snap
							into place to work for this particular type of game piece.
							Unfortunately, the piece can still be placed anywhere, not just in
							the hex grid on the map (the piece that worked from the previous

							get all of the pieces to this point, and then try to do some
							debugging to figure out why the pieces aren't placing correctly.

							We met with one of the group members from the previous semester,
							Devon, on Tuesday, the 3rd. Devon was extremely helpful and spent
							about two hours with us, going over the project, explaining how
							his team had been approaching the project, how different components
							were supposed to work, and just giving us general advice based on
							his team's experience working on the project.
						</p>
						<p>
							It sounded like Devon had put a substantial amount of work into making
							the hex grid work for the map, and had been working on getting the
							pieces to lock onto the grid. He managed to get one piece done last
							semester after the time that he spent on the grid. The next step was
							going to be getting that done for the rest of the pieces.
						</p>
						<p>
							Devon was not sure about the state of the cards -- he mentioned that
							someone had been working on them, but that they were unable to get them
							to work in the game. So, that's another area to look into next. After
							we get the rest of the pieces moving into place and the cards working, 
							hopefully we can approach the rest of the gameplay.

							Nathan got back to us on Sunday and told us that he would get in
							contact with the previous group members to see if he could find
							out what we needed to do to get the project to open correctly.
							After not hearing back for a couple of days, we contacted Dr. Hayes,
							and Dr. Hayes was able to get into contact with Mr. Piwowarski for us.
							Mr. Piwowarski had run the class previously, and was able to provide
							us with the files that were submitted to him at the end of the
							semester.
						</p>
						<p>
							From the files that were provided from Mr. Piwowarski, we were able to
							open the project with more success. It looked substantially better -- 
							the background actually looks like a table! We also discovered, after
							looking through some of the source code, that the dice are capable of
							being rolled (though nothing happens with the result just yet), and
							there is a game piece that is capable of being dragged onto the board.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is promising, and substantially better than what we saw before,
							but still not in the state that we imagined from the initial
							description of the state of the project. It sounded as though the
							turns were essentially already in place, and the game was practically
							playable in its current state.

							Nathan added me to the GitHub for the Game of Energy Digital project

							showing up correctly in Unity. The background, for instance, was
							not showing up -- Unity couldn't find the prefab.

							A day or so later, we were able to open the GameOfEnergy.exe file on

							contacted Nathan with screenshots of what we were seeing to see if
							it looked like what he had.
