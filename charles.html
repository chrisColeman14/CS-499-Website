							We met nearly every day this week to get the new requirements implemented for Nathan.  I worked on getting the industry tray
							pieces to properly decrement inventory values when the pieces were placed on the board as this was not working before.  This involved
							making some changes to preexisting scripts and adding newly written ones.  I also met with the group do go through the code and try to find
							solutions to meet each requirement in the minimum viable product.  We ran into a few merge conflicts that caused some work to get erased.  I will
							now work on the card scripts to get a deck implemented even if it is after the coding assignment.
						</p>
						<p>
							We met with Nathan again on Thursday.  He seemed happy with how much we finished in a week.  We will be meeting with him weekly or bi weekly until
							the end of the semester.
						</p>
						<p>
							We worked on the coding assignment this weekend and continued to work on the project through the weekend.  We will present on Monday the 13th.

							This week Nathan was able to meet us in order to discuss the scope of the project.  We showed him the version of
							the project we have and he seemed surprised as he thought the last group had gotten further than they did.  He did agree
							to scale back to scope in order to get a playable game before online multiplayer is added.  I took notes on the meeting and
							recorded a minimum viable product model that we all agreed upon.  Nathan also seemed ok with us working on this portion of the project
							after we complete the maintenance phase.  We can now focus on getting the game to work and have a new specific target to meet.

							I spent some time looking through all of the scripts associated with cards in the project.  The scripts follow a YouTube video
							that they seem to be based on.  The YouTube video is using cards in a different way and may not have been the best to use for this project.
							The scripts don't seem to be doing anything yet.  I have attempted creating a deck but do not yet know enough about to editor to get it to work.

							The group was able to get prefabs for the other pieces in the game.  I missed out and fell behind this week.  Taylor
							covered for me and made a prefab that I was going to make.  I did however meet with the group and try to learn more about the
							unity editor because it is not easy for me to use.

							We met in the library this week to go over the code in the project as a group.  Specifically we looked over the piecePlacer script
							to try and debug the code.  The script was confusing.  It seemed like some of the Boolean values were not actually changing anything when
							trying to place a piece.  We did get a somewhat better understanding of how the script works.  We also decided to use the only functioning
							pieced as a model and add the same functionality to the other five pieces in the game.

							We met with Devon who worked on this project last semester.  He went over the majority of the scripts and how he designed them.
							The mapping of the hex grid was especially confusing as he even confessed his design was complicated.  We learned that this is in fact the
							project that was turned in last semester.  The meeting with Devon helped us understand some of the code and he gave us a few tips on what to
							improve.  The meeting was helpful but I am still a little lost on how we are going to implement everything.

							After talking to doctor Hayes and getting access to another version of the previous project.  The state of the previous project is still
							extremely different than what we were initially told.  The game can't be played in this state.  It seems there is a structure there for the board
							and some scripts that handle switching through player turns. Other than that there isn't much actually completed for the project.
						</p>
						<p>
							If the current state of the project is what we received, a lot needs to be added before we can implement online multiplayer for Nathan.  We are
							going to try and rewrite some of the scripts and hopefully redo some of the logic that is in place.  The code is hard to trace.  It doesn't help that none
							of us are familiar with UNITY.

							During our second meeting this week we got to play test the actual board game with Nathan at a local game shop.

						The meetings for this week went well.  We met first on 9/05/17 to talk about our group and the class.
						Everyone in the group seems like the will be fun to work with.  We also went over the use case memo assignment this week.
						We thought of a few use cases to use for the assignment and got and early start on the project.  We met with Nathan this week and
						discussed what he expected from us for the project.
