							I was able to create a fossil fuel prefab and add colliders to the prefab. I have attempted to add 
							logic so that the piece behaves like the current working one where if the piece is over a valid spot it 
							turns green and when it is not it turns red. The current piece is always green but it should be behaving 
							just like the other piece.

							This week we had two major goals to accomplish which were having a code review over the piecePlacer.cs script 
							and to create prefab models to start the process of implementing the rest of the moveable pieces. The code review we had was long 
							and somewhat confusing but we began to understand a little more of the complete functionality of the script. We now understood a little 
							on how to create our own moveable piece from the code review and so we divided up one piece for each member to work on.

							We were able to have a meeting with a member who previously worked on the project 
							through Nathan to understand the design and implementation of the project. He gave us a lot 
							of insight into the project such as why scripts you would want to be in one controller were 
							broken up into multiple modules. There were bugs that he could not help us at all with because 
							they created by a different member.

							The version of the project we currently have from Nathan is in extremely alarming condition. The game only loads into a 
							purple screen that has no events to trigger. Through talking to Professor Hayes we were able to get a copy the previous group 
							had turned in which was in much better condition then the original. Though there were still issues we could immediately see.

							We had planned to add multiplayer to the game and get it to a state it could be published on Steam but features we were told needed tuning 
							like moving and placing pieces has turned into we need to implement moving and placing pieces. There is one piece that can be picked up 
							and placed and it should not be too hard to implement that logic for the remaining pieces but even the piece that can be moved still has multiple 
							bugs that we will have to fix.

							Our team had two meetings this week. In the first meeting we dicussed
							how we wanted to tackle our Project Specification Assignment. We decided
							to judge the amount of work from examples of previous groups and split our
							work up evenly. To prevent issues with group members spliting up the work
							we decided to have a google doc for all of us to work on. Doing this allows
							our team to work at the same time and also see what the other group members are
							typing. Finally to make sure if anyone felt overwelmed by the work assigned,
							everyone agreed that they could take on extra work to help out.
						</p>
						<p>
							The second meeting our team had this week we went to a game store in Lexington
							Kentucky to play the Game of Energy with Nathan our project manager. I had been
							looking forward to playing the game because it contains a decent amount of rules
							and one of the easiest ways to learn is by doing. We had met at 4:30pm on 9/14/17
							and played the game for over two hours. During this game we had all kinds of conversations
							from basic rules ideas, the scope of the project once again, implementation of game mechanics
							we were using, and all the way to other ideas that were simple addons, like the animation
							the game might display when carrying out a specific
							task, which was valuable information that the team has been curious about since reading the project
							details and requirements.
						</p>
						<p>
							The majority of my work this week has consisted of building upon the website.
							This time it involved more work going into the design of the website, but
							new functionality to the website was added in the form of a developer journal.
							Implementing this required me to do something new which was loading a html file
							into a div element using javascript. By 9/16/17 I have put into an estimatation of
							8 hours into working on the website.

						Our team had our first meeting 9/5/17 and we spoke about the expectations
						of the class, our teammates, and the project we were assigned.
						The second meeting we went over the use case memo assignment and brainstomed
						multiple use cases. We then narrowed down those use cases into two selections
						for the assignment. I found that both of our meetings went extremely well
						and the group seemed to fit pretty well with overlapping wants, work ethic,
						 and hobbies.

						I have started to create the skeleton of the website for our team,
						doing this will help us visualize what we want to implement. The skeleton
						only contained a navgation bar that consisted of a
						homepage, progress report, description, and meet the team tab. I had put in
						an estimate of 1-2 hours into this process.
