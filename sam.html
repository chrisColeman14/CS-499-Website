							Our game has changed a lot during this past week. We were able to make changes to our piece
							placer script this week which are pretty much complete. Rule enforcement has been added to
							placing pieces as well as where they could be placed based upon the dice which can be rolled.
							Taylor has done a lot of work implementing the functionality to the pieces and rule enforcement.
						</p>
						<p>
							I was able to change the appearance of the captain cards as well as add the images for the currency
							for the game. We hit a snag with the compatiblity of GitHub between computers and I had to redo
							most of the work that I did for a couple of hours but the changes have almost been fully completed
							again. We let Nathan know that we have made great strides this week in our meeting and that we didn't
							think that we would need to invest in addons. Moving forward we will be working to get the cards into
							the game and have rule inforcement for them as well as visible card decks.

							We met with Nathan again as a team and were able to discuss with him the current state of
							the project. We told him about the difficulties we were having and asked what he thought
							that we should do moving forward in the project, since it was not in a state that he or
							our group orinially expected. He suggested we find addons for Unity that may help our team
							implement the functions for the game that we were trying to accomplish on our own. As a team
							we tried to decided on addons but there were none that would really help us accomplish what we
							were looking for. The main thing our group was looking to find an addon for was something that
							would be useful for our game cards, but we were unable to find an addon that would actually
							do anything specific to our project.
						</p>
						<p>
							Taylor was able to update the script which controls the placement of the script which was a huge
							step in the right direction for our team. Although there are still changes to make to it, this allows
							our group to move forward with producing other changes to the game and its functionality.

							Our team was able to add all the colliders to all of the remaining pieces of the six which
							did not already have them added. We followed what the previous team had done when adding
							the colliders to the pieces but it seems to be issues with the script which decides when the
							piece should be able to be placed or not. The pieces are the only somewhat working piece of 
							the project at this time and it is going to be hard to do anything with actual gameplay
							before figuring out how to solve this problem. We will work together as a team to resolve
							the issue with the script and get the colliders correctly working so that our main issue
							will be solved.

							Our team was able to get the correct files into our GitHub repository so that we will be
							able to upload our changes and pull them down from other team members before working on them.
							Most of the team had a busy week aside from the project. We were able to get another piece's 
							colliders to be functional and the script updated for spawning the pieces. Now that the files
							are correctly uploaded into GitHub we should be able to work on the project easier individually
							rather than waiting until team meetings to do them on one computer together.

							Our team met this week and worked together on implementing the fuctionality of correctly
							placing the game pieces on to the hex board. We implemented functionality for all of the 
							other pieces, the previous team had only done this for one of the six, and then we updated
							the script which controls the placement of the game pieces. We were not able to get it working
							completely correct but we want to get all pieces to a place where we can atleast get them to
							spawn and lock on to the board in some fasion. After we have implemented these pieces we will
							work to make sure the script is correctly checking whether the piece is where it needs to be
							or not.

							We met wtih Devon, a member of the team who previously worked on our project to get some
							answers about the code with which we are working. He was very helpful and gave us some
							advice as well as a direction on where to start with the preexisting code. Devon seemed
							to be the main person who worked on the project previously and was very insightful on how
							he implemented the game board and game pieces. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Devon was not sure about certain parts that others had worked on in the group such as the
							cards but he said that someone had been working on them but there were not functional within
							the game at this time. Moving on from our meeting it should be easier to understand the code
							that we have recieved and be able to organize it into a more logical order.

							We asked Nathan if could gather information from the previous group who participated in the
							project so that we would be able to understand the opening of the project. We informed Dr. Hayes
							after a couple days that we still had not heard from Nathan regarding contacting the previous
							team and that it was crucial to our work to get this information as soon as possible. Dr. Hayes
							contacted Mr. Piwowarski who had previously taught the class to see if he could provide us with
							the previous project files which were submitted.
						</p>
						<p>
							We were able to recieve the files from Mr. Piwowarski, and recieved a much more operational project
							that we were able to open and review the project files. There is a nicely designed game board and some
							slight functionality with the previously implemented game pieces. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The project is not in the state that our team originally thought, but we will be determining what we 
							should meet with Nathan and discuss concerning the project and its creation moving forward. Since the
							game is not in much of a playable state, then there will need to be some major changes made and the
							original goal of multiplayer implementation will need to be reconsidered.

							Our team recieved the GitHub repository for the Game of Energy Digital project on Sunday,
							9/17, but some members were unable to open the files correctly. The files were not 
							displaying correctly in Unity and we were not able to run the .exe file that was built
							for the game correctly.
						</p>
						<p>
							On my computer we were eventually able to open the .exe file but it was not working
							correctly either. The .exe displayed a poorly drawn set of shapes that were supposed to
							resemble the game board and there was no functionality at all. We are checking with Nathan
							to see if what we have in these files are what he expected us to be working with.

							We met with Nathan on Thursday, 9/14, to get a hands on experience with the actual board
							game we will be designing. We were able to play the Game of Energy which allowed for 
							team building as well as an overall knowledge of the rules and functions for the game. We
							feel as if the game is well designed and look forward to designing the digital version.
